A knowledge test game

![Vite + React + Typescript + Eslint + Prettier](/resources/screenshot.png)

I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

## Installation

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `yarn dev`
